## 📌 Overview

The **AI-Based Pokémon Battle Arena** is a next-gen Pokémon simulator that combines **real-time battle mechanics**, **AI-driven strategies**, and a **Modular Control Protocol (MCP) Server** to enable seamless multiplayer gameplay.
This project builds upon the existing MCP server framework to enhance the battle logic, data handling, and AI decision-making.

## 🧠 **AI Battle Mechanics**

* **Attack Decision**: AI chooses moves based on type advantage, damage calculation, and probability weighting.
* **Defensive Strategy**: AI evaluates its remaining HP and decides whether to use defensive or status moves.
* **Learning Mode**: AI can record past battles to improve future performance.

## 🌍 **Multiplayer via MCP Server**

The **MCP Server** manages:

* Player authentication
* Matchmaking between players and AI
* Real-time battle state syncing
* Communication of moves and battle results
---
## 📈 **Future Improvements**

* 🎨 GUI-based Battle Arena
* 🌐 WebSocket-based multiplayer
* 🏆 Ranked matchmaking system
* 🧪 Advanced reinforcement learning AI

If you want, I can now **add Pokémon-themed badges & battle GIFs** so the README feels more like a real Pokémon game page.
Do you want me to make it that way? It’ll look 🔥
